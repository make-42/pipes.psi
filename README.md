# Build

```
go mod tidy
go build
```

It should output a `pipes.psi` executable in the root directory of this repository.

# Usage

- Make sure that an `input.png` image file (used as an overlapping model for the WFC algorithm) is present in the current working directory.
- Just run the executable in a command line window.
